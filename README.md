Why are these patched preventions still here? [Answer is in the Link](./docs/patches.md)


## ⚠️ Limitations  
The prevention system in our addon is **basic**, meaning not all exploits or cheat movements can be completely prevented. While it helps reduce unfair advantages, more advanced hacks may still bypass some detections.  


## 📌 Installation
1. Go to the official [BlueMods website](https://bluemods.neocities.org) or GitHub page.
2. Download the BlueMods Addon file.
3. Open your Minecraft world settings.
4. Import the downloaded BlueMods Addon into your world.
5. Enable **Beta APIs** and **Education Edition** in your world settings.
6. After importing, type `!ping` in the chat.
7. If the addon is working, you’ll get a response. If not, double-check the addon’s requirements.

1. Before using commands like `!?` or `!help`, you need to give a player admin rights.
2. Type: `!op add <player>` (replace `<player>` with the exact username, including capitalization).
3. If `!op` doesn’t work, use this command instead: `/tag @s add admin`.
4. **Using Commands:** Always use the player’s exact username (including uppercase and lowercase letters) when running commands.
5. **Important Tip:** Never give the **"op"** or **"trusted"** tags to players you don’t know or trust. This keeps your server safe.

## 🤔 Recommendations
- [`8Crafter's Debug Sticks, Chat Ranks, Custom UI, and JavaScript Commands/Script REPL, and Server Utilities`](https://modbay.org/mods/1240-8crafters-debug-sticks.html) add-on - It is highly recommended that you enable this because it will allow for the UIs of this add-on to look a lot nicer, the add-on itself is also extremely useful.
