## **GUIDES**
### **Download the Addon**
1. Go to the official BlueMods website or GitHub page.
2. Download the BlueMods Addon file.

### **Import the Addon**
1. Open your Minecraft world settings.
2. Import the downloaded BlueMods Addon into your world.
3. Enable **Beta APIs** and **Education Edition** in your world settings.

### **Check if the Addon Works**
1. After importing, type `!ping` in the chat.
2. If the addon is working, you’ll get a response. If not, double-check the addon’s requirements.

### **Set Up Admin Permissions**
1. Before using commands like `!?` or `!help`, you need to give a player admin rights.
2. Type: `!op add <player>` (replace `<player>` with the exact username, including capitalization).
3. If `!op` doesn’t work, use this command instead: `/tag @s add admin`.
4. **Using Commands:** Always use the player’s exact username (including uppercase and lowercase letters) when running commands.
5. **Important Tip:** Never give the **"op"** or **"trusted"** tags to players you don’t know or trust. This keeps your server safe.

## **REQUIREMENTS**
- **Education Edition**: Must be enabled for `!mute` and `!unmute` commands to function.
- **Beta APIs**: Required to enable command functionality.
- **Upcoming Creator Features**: Enable for custom entities and advanced features.

**Why enable these?**  
These settings are essential for running commands and features that operate in beta mode. By enabling them, you ensure that your server is secure from cheaters and the addon functions as intended.
