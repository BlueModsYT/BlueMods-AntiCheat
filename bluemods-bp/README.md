<p align="center">BlueMods AntiCheat for Minecraft Bedrock is a powerful tool designed to protect your server from hackers & cheaters.</p>

## ⚠️ Limitations  

The prevention system in our addon is **basic**, meaning not all exploits or cheat movements can be completely prevented. While it helps reduce unfair advantages, more advanced hacks may still bypass some detections.  

## 🚀 Features  

- Detects and blocks common cheats such as illegal items, crasher, and invalid namespoof.  
- Customizable settings for server owners to fine-tune protection.  
- Regular updates to improve detection and prevention methods.  

## 📌 Installation

**Download the Addon:**
- Go to the official BlueMods website or GitHub page.
- Download the BlueMods Addon file.
**Import the Addon:**
- Open your Minecraft world settings.
- Import the downloaded BlueMods Addon into your world.
- Make sure to enable **Beta APIs** and **Education Edition** in your world settings.
**Check if the Addon Works:**
- After importing, type `!ping` in the chat.
- If the addon is working, you’ll get a response. If not, double-check the addon’s requirements.
**Set Up Admin Permissions:**
- Before using commands like `!?` or `!help`, you need to give a player admin rights.
- Type: `!op add <player>` (replace `<player>` with the exact username, including capitalization).
- If `!op` doesn’t work, use this command instead: `/tag @s add admin`.
- **Using Commands:** Always use the player’s exact username (including uppercase and lowercase letters) when running commands.
- **Important Tip:** Never give the **"op"** or **"trusted"** tags to players you don’t know or trust. This keeps your server safe.

## 🔧 Configuration  

The addon includes a configuration panel where you can enable or disable specific detections. Modify the settings to suit your server's needs.  

## 📢 Future Improvements  

We are actively working on enhancing the detection system to cover more exploits and provide better security for servers. If you have suggestions or encounter issues, feel free to contribute or report them on our GitHub.
