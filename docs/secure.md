### **Why Patched Prevention Exists:**
- **Admins or Friends Can Cause Issues:**
  - Sometimes, even trusted players (like admins or friends) might accidentally or intentionally do something dangerous, like using commands or actions that could break the game or harm the server.
  - The patched prevention ensures that certain risky actions are blocked, even if they’re done by someone with admin permissions.

- **Safety First:**
  - The goal is to keep your server or world safe and stable, no matter who is playing or what they try to do.
  - It’s better to prevent problems before they happen, rather than fixing them afterward.

### **What This Means for You:**
- You can still use commands and features, but some actions that could cause harm are blocked.
- This ensures your server stays secure and fun for everyone, even if someone makes a mistake or tries to do something risky.
